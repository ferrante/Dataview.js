Dataview.js goal is to provide a software that reduces the number of mistakes dealing with
data inside JS applications. Thus, you can lock the data properties and allow only a few 
methods to modify them.

Dataview.js is unit-tested with a strong bit of help coming from JsTestDriver and Sinon libraries.
